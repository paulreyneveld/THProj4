# TH Project 4

This project was built to satisfy the requirements of the fourth Treehouse FSJS Tech Degree project. 

This project contains a 'phrase-hunter' app. It starts with a pre-seeded selection of common phrases. The user then
has the opportunity to guess the phrase with each wrong guess resulting in a penalty or 'heart-loss'. Once all of the
hearts have been dispatched the user loses. In the event that the user is able to guess the phrase before running out
of hearts, the user is then a winner and can choose to play the game again.
